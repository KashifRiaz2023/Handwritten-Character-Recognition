# Handwritten Character Recognition System

This project aims to build a model that can recognize handwritten characters using deep learning techniques. The model classifies individual characters and can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences.

## Features

- Classification of individual handwritten characters.
- Utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate character recognition.
- Data preprocessing techniques for effective model training.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy and generalization.
- Functionality to make predictions on new handwritten samples.

## Algorithm Used

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning model designed to effectively handle image data. CNNs automatically learn spatial features, making them ideal for recognizing complex patterns in handwritten characters.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
- **OpenCV**

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes a variety of handwritten character images. Each image represents a single character, enabling the model to learn and classify individual symbols effectively.
